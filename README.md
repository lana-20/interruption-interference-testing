## Why Interruption/Interference Scenarios are Important in Testing the Mobile App Activities

üìù This post is mostly about Android.

Test the following common scenarios for mobile app testing:
* ***Rotation*** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/218906435-d084f2a4-3720-4959-97b1-584eaa1cf74d.png" width=40>
* ***Multi-window*** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/218907179-6b0588ad-58dd-4e37-a60b-9b86749ee821.png" width=80>
* ***Language Input*** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/218907607-999608ec-56c8-4274-acd5-e878fb2a3dcd.png" width=40>
* ***User Taps Back Button***<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/218907897-7318ec9d-6c30-449c-b7d1-9348e1f98441.png" width=40>
  * [Override the onBackPressed() method to implement some custom behavior, for example a "confirm-quit" dialog](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/state-changes#back)
* ***System kills app process*** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/218908294-629df897-917d-4732-a559-d1b2491eee82.png" width=40>


A poorly implemented [Android Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle) can lead to the following results:
* Crashing if the user receives a phone call or switches to another app while using your app.
* Consuming valuable system resources when the user is not actively using it.
* Losing the user's progress if they leave your app and return to it at a later time.
* Crashing or losing the user's progress when the screen rotates between landscape and portrait orientation.


### [Test your app's activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/testing)

Activities serve as containers for every user interaction within your app, so it's important to test how your app's activities behave during device-level events, such as the following:

* Another app, such as the device's phone app, interrupts your app's activity.
* The system destroys and recreates your activity.
* The user places your activity in a new windowing environment, such as picture-in-picture (PIP) or multi-window.

In particular, it's important to ensure that your activity behaves correctly in response to the events described in [Understanding the Activity Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle).

Different events, some user-triggered and some system-triggered, can cause an Activity to transition from one state to another. The [Activity State Changes document](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/state-changes) describes some common cases in which such transitions happen, and how to handle those transitions.
